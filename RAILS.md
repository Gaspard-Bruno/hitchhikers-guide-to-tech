# Ruby on Rails

## When and why do we use it?

Rails is used at G+B to make APIs that serve our websites & apps but also as SaaS.

We like the bootstrapping speed of a RoR project but also the pre-built capabilities like environment management, async jobs & the classic ActiveRecord powered database queries. The gems that fit perfectly into a Rails app are also a great plus, solving complex problems with a single line of code.

## Gems

Gems are an essential part in our workflow and we like to follow the principle of why re-inventing the wheel when a library created and production tested by 1000+ developers already does the job well.

Our experience with Rails led us to use some amazing gems like [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise), 
[blueprint](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint), [sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq), 
[redis](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-rails) or 
[pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit).
