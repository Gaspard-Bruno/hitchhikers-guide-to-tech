# The Hitchhikers Guide to Tech

## What is this?

Hitchhikers guide to tech is an opinionated tech guide from the G+B development team members on how we like to do tech and what do we have to say about it.

Its inspiration comes from the Douglas Adams novel “The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy” about a guide of everything in the galaxy written also in a very opinionated way.

## How is it organised?

Every page talks about a language, framework or technology that we use or that it’s interesting for us. Some pages will be connected, others will be standalone.

Here is an index of our current pages to get started:
